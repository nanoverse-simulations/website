This does not necessarily need to match the lattice topology, although they must be compatible. For example, one could use a TriangularLattice with a Rectangle shape, but not with a Cuboid.</p><table><tr><th>Member</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td><a href='LLine.html'>Line</a></td><td>Line</td><td>A line is a 1D boundary with two endpoints.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='HHexagon.html'>Hexagon</a></td><td>Hexagon</td><td>A hexagon is a 2D boundary with three sets of parallel sides, all equidistant from a center point.
