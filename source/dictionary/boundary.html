If an nanoverse.runtime.agent reaches the boundary, the simulation halts.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='TTetris.html'>Tetris</a></td><td>TetrisBoundary</td><td>The Tetris boundary is a 2D boundary for AGENT layers only. It has a hard boundary on the bottom edge, a halting boundary on the top edge, and periodic boundaries on the left and right edges.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='PPlaneRingReflecting.html'>PlaneRingReflecting</a></td><td>PlaneRingReflecting</td><td>The PlaneRingReflecting boundary is a 2D boundary for CONTINUUM nanoverse.runtime.layers only. It has reflecting boundary conditions top and bottom, and periodic boundaries left and right. For equivalent boundary conditions in AGENT nanoverse.runtime.layers, see the PlaneRingHard boundary.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='AAbsorbing.html'>Absorbing</a></td><td>AbsorbingBoundary</td><td>The absorbing boundary is for CONTINUUM nanoverse.runtime.layers only. It holds the boundary value constantly at zero. For equivalent behavior in AGENT nanoverse.runtime.layers, see the Arena boundary.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='PPlaneRingHard.html'>PlaneRingHard</a></td><td>PlaneRingHardBoundary</td><td>The PlaneRingHard boundary is a 2D boundary for AGENT nanoverse.runtime.layers only. It has hard boundary conditions at top and bottom, and periodic boundary conditions left and right. For equivalent behavior in CONTINUUM nanoverse.runtime.layers, see the PlaneRingReflecting boundary.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='PPeriodic.html'>Periodic</a></td><td>PeriodicBoundary</td><td>A periodic boundary wraps each edge around to a parallel edge on the other side. It requires that the simulation space have a shape with exactly twice the edges of its dimension (ie, Line, Rectangle, Cuboid). Periodic boundaries are compatible with both continuum and nanoverse.runtime.agent nanoverse.runtime.layers.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='AArena.html'>Arena</a></td><td>ArenaBoundary</td><td>The Arena boundary is for AGENT nanoverse.runtime.layers only. It allows agents to drift over the boundary while resolving an event, but any nanoverse.runtime.agent that ends an event over the boundary is removed from the system. For the equivalent behavior in a CONTINUUM layer, see the Absorbing boundary.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='TTetrisReflecting.html'>TetrisReflecting</a></td><td>TetrisReflectingBoundary</td><td>The TetrisReflecting boundary is a 2D boundary for CONTINUUM layers only. It has a reflecting boundary on the bottom edge, an absorbing boundary on the top edge, and periodic boundaries on the left and right edges.</td></tr></table></body></html>
