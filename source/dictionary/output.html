The indexing algorithm used is common to all reports and is used internally within Nanoverse simulations. One file per instance.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='VVisualizationSerializer.html'>VisualizationSerializer</a></td><td>VisualizationSerializer</td><td>Generates the specified visualization for each instance of the simulation.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='RRandomSeedWriter.html'>RandomSeedWriter</a></td><td>RandomSeedWriter</td><td>Produces a one-line text file for each instance, with the file containing the long integer used to seed the random number generator for the simulation instance.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='HHaltTimeWriter.html'>HaltTimeWriter</a></td><td>HaltTimeWriter</td><td>HaltTimeWriter creates a single, tab-delimited text file, with each row containing the (simulation) time and cause of simulation halt for each instance run.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='IIndividualHaltWriter.html'>IndividualHaltWriter</a></td><td>IndividualHaltWriter</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td><a href='CContinuumStateWriter.html'>ContinuumStateWriter</a></td><td>ContinuumStateWriter</td><td>Produces binary files containing frame-by-frame continuum value data for each continuum layer. The ContinuumStateWriter produces two files per continuum layer per simulation instance: one representing the overall state of the layer, and one capturing extremum metadata.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='HHighlightWriter.html'>HighlightWriter</a></td><td>HighlightWriter</td><td>Highlights can be used to flag particular coordinates for special accents in visualizations. HighlightWriter produces files containing yes-or-no values for each location at each recorded time in a simulation. The writer produces one file per specified channel per instance.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='PProgressReporter.html'>ProgressReporter</a></td><td>ProgressReporter</td><td>LEGACY: ProgressReporter provides verbose output concerning Nanoverse's state and the progress of the simulation. This information should be gradually replaced by slf4j logging with several levels of verboseness.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='TTimeWriter.html'>TimeWriter</a></td><td>TimeWriter</td><td>Creates a binary file capturing the number of simulation state updates and the corresponding simulation time. Used in creating visualizations.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='CCellStateWriter.html'>CellStateWriter</a></td><td>CellStateWriter</td><td>Records the state of all agents in the system in a plain-text vector format. The relationship between coordinate and vector index is recorded by the CoordinateIndexer output mode. This output is used in the generation of map visualizations.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='CContinuumHistogramWriter.html'>ContinuumHistogramWriter</a></td><td>ContinuumHistoWriter</td><td>ContinuumHistoWriter provides a histogram of solute concentrations at each time point recorded in each instance of the simulation. Data are reported in a tab-delimited text file, with one text file per simulation instance.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='CCensusWriter.html'>CensusWriter</a></td><td>CensusWriter</td><td>Census writer produces one tab-delimited file per simulation instance. Each row in the file corresponds to a time point, and the columns capture the number of agents of a given state (class) observed at that time. There is one column for each state observed through the course of the simulation.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='RRunningTimeWriter.html'>RunningTimeWriter</a></td><td>RunningTimeWriter</td><td>Produces a tab-separated text file reporting the simulation and wall-clock running time since the last time the file was updated. Used to track performance.</td></tr><tr><td><a href='SSurfaceCensusWriter.html'>SurfaceCensusWriter</a></td><td>SurfaceCensusWriter</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td><a href='CCorrelationWriter.html'>CorrelationWriter</a></td><td>CorrelationWriter</td><td>Calculate the pairwise correlation between individuals at every distance. This calculation is used to measure spatial structure. The results are measured at a specified time point, and aggregated over all simulations.</td></tr></table></body></html>
